## Hapara frontend coding challenge

You'll be building a simple header with a drop down menu interaction. Spend around 2 hours on this you don't have to complete everything.

### Design and behavior:

Login to invision here to see and inspect the design: https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/projects/prototypes/13483555

User: dev_candidate@hapara.com

Password: feTest

To get the fonts we have used copy this code into the `<head>` of your html document:

`<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,600" rel="stylesheet">`

### Code Spec:

Use any modern JS framework (Angular, React, Vue) to create the supplied design.
Try to include two reusable components using your framework. Examples of these might be the navigation menu on the top left and the dropdown menu on the top right.

When clicking the `student@school.org` option in the drop down the UI should change as per the design to the student view. Then when clicking the `teacher@school.org` option it should change back to it's original state.

A unit test to prove some functionality works.

### Bonus points if you provide any of the following: 

A responsive layout which adjusts to various screen sizes. The design does not include a mobile version so it is up to
the developer to use thier own judgement to present this.

### How to send it to us:

Please fork this repository or create your own git repository and provide us access to clone it when you are finished, with instructions to build and run the application.
