## Hapara frontend coding challenge

You'll be building a simple header with a drop down menu interaction.

### Design and behavior:

Login to invision here to see the design: https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/projects/prototypes/13483555

User: dev_candidate@hapara.com

Password: feTest

To get the fonts we have used copy this code into the `<head>` of your html document:

`<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,600" rel="stylesheet">`

### Code Spec:

Use any modern JS framework (Angular, React, Vue) to create the supplied design.
You're free to use as many third party JS libraries that you see fit.

### Bonus points if you provide: 

A responsive layout which adjusts to various screen sizes. The design does not include a mobile version so it is up to
the developer to use thier own judgement to present this.

### How to send it to us:

Please fork this repository or create your own git repository and provide us access to clone it when you are finished, with instructions to build and run the application.
